    "- Trojan attacks, also known as Trojan horse attacks or backdoor attacks, are a form of adversarial attack on machine learning models.\n",
    "- During training, the attacker injects a trojan trigger into the training data, causing the model to learn an undesirable correlation between the trigger and the target class.\n",
    "- Inference with a trojaned model results in it always predicting the adversarial target class when the trojan trigger is present in the input.\n",
    "- Detecting trojan attacks can be challenging.\n",
    "- They pose significant security risks in critical applications."
